Hi all! Thanks for being here. In this blog I share some personal experiences and thoughts related to my research in Colombia and the US. My hope is that this can be helpful for other researchers doing cross-cultural research and to anyone who is just curious!

Few warnings before you continue reading:
1. This is more a personal than an academic blog, so I will be sharing thoughts that might not be well elaborated, argued, or tested (so donâ€™t quote me on them!).
2. What I share is inspired in my research experience, but to protect participants confidentiality, I will need to be unspecific sometimes.
3. I am not sure what I am going to share yet, but sharing personal experiences is not always easy, so keep that in mind if you decide to give me any feedback (which is very welcomed!).
4. Last, but not least: this are my personal reflections and nothing written here reflects the standing of the institutions I work or am affiliated with.

Now, if you want to know more about me and my interests you can read the first entry, not surprisingly called 'About me'. If not, you can go directly to the posts :)

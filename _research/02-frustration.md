During my masterâ€™s, my research was focused on understanding the ways in which forensic anthropologists who search for victims of forced disappearance deal with the frustration of not being able to find them. In Colombia, there are approximately 121.768 victims of this crime, and less than 80 forensic anthropologists have the challenge of finding what happened to them and searching for the remains of those who are dead. I found that to process the negative emotions associated with failure, the forensic anthropologists reappraise what they judge as successes and place special value in the relationships that they build with the families of the victims of forced disappearance.

I'm a graduate student at Duke University working with [Dr. Felipe De Brigard](https://www.imclab.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. John Pearson](https://pearsonlab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} to understand the computations underlying causal reasoning in humans. I also jointly work with [Paul Bello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=72lZt54AAAAJ){:target="_blank"} and [Will Bridewell](https://paravidya.com/){:target="_blank"} to implement some of these ideas in their cognitive framework ARCADIA.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Selmer Bringsjord](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu/){:target="_blank"} on using formal logic to enable flexible reasoning in AI.

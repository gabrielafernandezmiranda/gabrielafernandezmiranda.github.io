During the Fall 2020 semster at Duke I was a graduate teaching
assistant for Dr. Ruth Day's online course PSY 102: Introduction to
Cognitive Psychology.  In addition to grading and leading discussion
sections, I also helped students develop their own experiments to
demonstrate classic principles in cognitive psychology.

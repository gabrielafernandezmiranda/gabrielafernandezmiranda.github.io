For my last teaching assistantship at Duke, I had the opportunity of
TAing a seminar course entitled Psychology of Imagination taught by
[Dr. Tamar Kushnir](http://ecclabduke.com). Every week, we read a few
papers on a different facet of imagination (e.g., remembering,
counterfactual thinking, pretend play in children), the students wrote
short blog posts about their reactions to the readings, and finally we
discussed the studies and findings in class. The most exciting part
was helping students with term papers that they worked on through the
semester, in which they independently researched a subtopic on
imagination, integrated that research into a novel thesis, and talked
about the implications of their views. Overall, this was a fantastic
class in which I could lead discussions, share my own research on
imagination, and help students find their own paths.
